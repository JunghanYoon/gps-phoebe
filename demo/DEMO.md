# Demo Environment with gPS Phoebe

This document will guide you through all the steps needed to deploy a demo site
using gPS Phoebe with server side tagging.

For the demo, you will deploy:

-   A demo website of a retail store, using the
    [GTM Boilerplate](https://github.com/gtech-professional-services/gtm-boilerplate).
-   A Vertex AI model and endpoint, created from fake generated data.
-   A Google Tag Manager variable to hold the predicted value.

Be mindful that each component has some cost associated to it, so make sure to
monitor the billing associated with your project to avoid unexpected charges.

Note: if you just want to deploy the tool and not the demo environment, skip
this document and follow the [main one](../README.md).

## Requirements

-   [Server-side Tag Manager](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/learn/sst-fundamentals)
    deployed.
-   A Google Tag Manager Web Container created (no need to have anything
    configured yet).
-   [GTM Boilerplate](https://github.com/gtech-professional-services/gtm-boilerplate)
    deployed and configured to use the Google Tag Manager Web container.
    You can find the detailed instructions
    [here](https://github.com/gtech-professional-services/gtm-boilerplate/blob/main/website/README.md#guided-deployment).
-   A local environment with [Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) and
    [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) installed. We recommend using
    [cloud shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell) for this deployment as all the
    tools needed are already available.

## Installation

1.  Clone this repository to your local environment and move to the demo folder
    using the commands below.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/google/gps-phoebe
cd gps-phoebe/demo
```

2.  Open the file `terraform.tfvars` and provide the appropriate values for each
    field. Our recommendation for the deployment region is to use the same as
    your server side tagging server, as that will reduce the network latency.

3.  Initialize the terraform environment.

```sh
terraform init
```

4.  Start the model deployment. Make sure to follow the prompts to confirm the
    operation (you need to enter yes when prompted if you agree with the
    changes, otherwise the script will exit).

```sh
terraform apply
```

5.  Configure Tag Manager

Download the template files from your browser:

-   [`gtm/phoebe_demo_web_container.json`](gtm/phoebe_demo_web_container.json)
-   [`gtm/phoebe_demo_server_container.json`](gtm/phoebe_demo_server_container.json)

From to the [Google Tag Manager UI](https://tagmanager.google.com/#/home),
select the web container, and then click on `Import Container` from the `Admin`
tab. Select the `phoebe_demo_web_container.json` file and choose overwrite as
the import option.

Next, go to the `Variables` section, open the `Server Container URL` variable
and replace the sample value with the server container URL.

Repeat the import operation from the server container, and use the
`phoebe_demo_server_container.json` file as the import file.

Next, go to the `Variables` section, and replace the following variables with
the right values:

-   `Google Cloud Project Number`: The project number is shown in the
    [home dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard) of your
    cloud project.
-   `Google Cloud Region`: The region you used for the deployment above.
